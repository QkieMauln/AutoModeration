# Qky's Simple Moderation Bot

This bot is just moderate your server like others bot did. Not to brag or anything but this bot is focused on transparency. Yeah we still use the outdated message commands

### How to steal th- I mean to run this bot?

---

- First you need to git clone! Yeah u know this part really well.

- Second! This is important! You need to go to inside the directory of your clone.

- Third! What you want to do is install yarn globally! because haha NPM bad

- Fourth! just run yarn i guess. and it will install automatically.

- Fifth! and this is what you've been waiting for! run the typescript node and pointing at index typescript file.

### I need beginner friendly tutorial!

---

1. First what u want to do is

```
git clone https://github.com/QkieMauln/AutoModeration
cd AutoModeration
```

2. alright this one. If u familiar with yarn do

```
yarn
```

- or not?

```
npm i
```

3. Ok this part is tricky you can just run this with only this command and your done! :D

```
DISCORDTOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE ts-node index.ts
```

4. or... you can just create `.env` file and put

```
DISCORDTOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

- then save

5. And run

```
ts-node index.ts
```

### Im Still Confused!!!

---

Lets assume that you want instant copy paste

```
git clone https://github.com/QkieMauln/AutoModeration
cd AutoModeration
npm i
echo DISCORDTOKEN=Your_Discord_Token_PasteItHERE > .env
npm start
```

Happy Coding!
